A skype replacement for devs working on github repositories.

This mesage app is a client that requires no server beside your github repositories.

Messages exchanged in conversations linked to a repo are committed (like daily) in the repo.

Signaling to establish connection with peers is done through github discussions.

Call and video recording can be saved to S3 or drive.
